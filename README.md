# re-formers-server
This is a HTTP websocket server for re-formers websocket client.
The goal is to make a sample form editor with extremely basic features such as adding a form element (A question in this case) and editing the same in a non persisting server.
Pssst... It's a fun project to explore web sockets in go and making your client as elaborate as possible.
